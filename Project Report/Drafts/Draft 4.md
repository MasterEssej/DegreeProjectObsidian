## Introduction

In this project report, I will provide an overview of my game development assignment that revolves around a unique 2D puzzle game combining Top-Down and Side-Scroller modes. The report will focus on my work process, goals, time estimates, new skills and knowledge gained, and the challenges faced throughout the 10-week project. The aim of this report is to demonstrate my growth as a game developer and showcase how I approached and overcame obstacles to achieve my objectives.

## Work Process

**Week 1:**
- Brainstorming and outlining the concept for the game, inspired by thoughts of different dimensions and perspectives on reality
- Researching similar games and identifying key features
- Defining the target audience and platform

**Week 2:**
- Designing game mechanics, including the ability to switch between Top-Down and Side-Scroller modes and rotate 90 degrees in the Top-Down view
- Creating a storyboard and level design, focusing on puzzles and locked doors that require changing perspectives to navigate and move around
- Establishing a timeline for project completion

**Week 3:**
- Coding the game's basic framework using Unity and C#
- Implementing character movement and controls, including seamless transitions between game modes
- Setting up the game environment and assets using RuleTiles for 3D BoxColliders and custom functionality

(Continue to detail your work process for each week)

## Goals

My primary goals for this project were to develop a fully functional game prototype that combines Top-Down and Side-Scroller modes by the end of the 10-week period, learn new programming languages and game development tools, particularly focusing on RuleTiles, enhance problem-solving skills through the development of innovative game mechanics and level design, and improve focus and motivation throughout the project.

## Time Estimate

- Initial planning and research: 1 week
- Design and development: 6 weeks
- Testing and debugging: 2 weeks
- Finalization and submission: 1 week

## New Skills and Knowledge

Throughout the project, I acquired proficiency in Unity and C# for game development, gained an understanding of game design principles with an emphasis on combining different game modes, became familiar with RuleTiles and their applications in creating versatile game environments, and enhanced my project management and self-motivation skills.

## Challenges

During the development process, I faced several challenges, including balancing game complexity with available resources and time constraints, ensuring seamless transitions between Top-Down and Side-Scroller modes as well as accurate TileMap positioning regardless of rotation, learning to use RuleTiles effectively to create BoxColliders and custom functionality, and overcoming personal obstacles related to focus and motivation during the project.

## Conclusion

This 10-week game development project has provided invaluable learning experiences and opportunities for growth as a game developer. Through the challenges faced and the skills gained, I have developed a strong foundation in game design and programming, particularly in the innovative combination of game modes and the use of RuleTiles. This project has also highlighted the importance of maintaining focus and motivation throughout the development process, preparing me for future endeavors in the industry.
